# mkblog.sh

mkblog.sh is a simple blogging system, written in sh. It allows you to write
blog posts in Markdown and compile them into a nice HTML site with a single
command.

## Usage
First, create a skeleton for your new blog using `mkblog.sh init <directory>`.

Add Markdown files in the subdirectory pages to create additional pages, or in
posts to create blog posts. For the posts, make sure you follow the
`yyyy-mm-dd-title.md` naming convention. For example:
`2016-02-04-Hello, world!.md`.

Then, run `mkblog.sh build <directory>` to build your blog. The HTML will be
placed in a subdirectory named `build` in the directory you are building.

To edit what your blog looks like, just edit `templates/header.html` and
`templates/footer.html` according to your wishes. However, try to not remove
the skip div element, as it aids accessibility.

## Example directory structure
If you are doing everything right, your blog directory should look like this.

    .
    ├── pages
    │   ├── About.md
    │   └── Contact.md
    ├── posts
    │   ├── 2016-06-02-Hello again.md
    │   └── 2016-04-02-Hello, world!.md
    └── templates
        ├── footer.html
        └── header.html

## Dependencies
mkblog.sh, aside from some standard tooling, only requires a markdown parser
that parses stdin and sends the HTML to stdout, named "markdown". `discount` is
recommended.
