# mkblog.sh

mkblog.sh is a simple blogging system, written in sh. It allows you to write
blog posts in Markdown and compile them into a nice HTML site with a single
command.

## Usage
First, create a skeleton for your new blog using `mkblog.sh init <directory>`.

Then, start blogging by putting Markdown files in this directory. To ensure
proper sorting of blog posts, use filenames that sort nicely. The recommended
format is year-month-day-title.md. For example: 2016-02-04-hello-world.md.

When your have one or more posts, run `mkblog.sh build <directory>` to create
your blog. The HTML will be placed in a subdirectory named `build` in the
directory of your blog.

If you want to edit what your blog looks like, just edit templates/header.html
and templates/footer.html to your wishes.

## Dependencies
mkblog.sh, aside from some standard tooling, only requires a markdown parser
that parses stdin and sends the HTML to stdout, named "markdown". `discount` is
recommended.

## License
mkblog.sh is licensed under the GNU AGPLv3+, with the exception of the files
generated by the init command, which are licensed under CC0.
